title: "Launching and sustaining municipal open data initiatives: how Open North can help"
---
Cities across Canada are committing more than ever to implementing open data infrastructure and policies, which in turn means they now have a greater need for strategic planning and tactical support in order to draw the full benefits of open data. 

Following the launch of the [Open Cities Index](https://www.publicsectordigest.com/Articles/view/1547) by Public Sector Digest (PSD), Open North decided to partner up with the PSD to launch our Open Data Strategies Partnership.

As a first step in this exciting partnership, we will be offering an [open data webinar](https://www.publicsectordigest.com/products/view/832) on **May 17th from 1-2 p.m. ET**, which will allow us to present new technical and strategic support offerings tailored to municipalities’ needs, and to equip attendees with best practices and resources to launch and sustain open data initiatives. 

Led by open data experts Jury Konga (Open Knowledge Foundation) and Jean-Noé Landry (Open North), this webinar will present specific examples of strategic planning and evaluation frameworks for municipalities, as well as stakeholder engagement mechanisms best practices.

But this is only the first step. The webinar will also be an opportunity to present Open North’s newly assembled multi-disciplinary team of expert associates, which will be available for follow-up consultations and projects to support the development and achievement of successful municipal and provincial open data programs and initiatives. 

Details of this new service offering will be presented during the webinar.
