			<h3 id="1">Open Smart Cities in Canada</h3>
			<h5>Jan 2017 - Mar 2018<br />
			Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), GeoConnections Program</h5>

			<p>An <strong style="color:#c60000;">Open Smart City</strong> is where residents, civil society, academics, and the private sector collaborate with public officials to mobilize data and technologies when warranted in an ethical, accountable and transparent way to govern the city as a fair, viable and liveable commons and balance economic development, social progress and environmental responsibility.</p>
			<p>In collaboration with leading researchers and Canadian smart cities, as well as provinces with advanced open government programs, this project will define an open smart city and develop a guide for city decision makers and stakeholders. With a focus on interoperability and inter-jurisdictional coordination, this project supports capacity building and knowledge exchange. There are six main outputs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4fs8/" target="_blank">Executive summary of a smart city environmental scan (E-Scan) and five Canadian case studies.</a></strong> This report identifies international shapers of smart cities and their components and describes current smart city practices across Canada.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qbyzj/" target="_blank">Assessment of Canadian smart city practices.</a></strong> In depth city profiles were developed as a result of interviews with smart city representatives from the cities of Edmonton, Guelph, Montreal, and Ottawa. Preliminary results of the Assessment and Gap Analysis were presented during a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B739vUevKlPgX1ZTSjJZMjZabDg/view?usp=drive_web" target="_blank">webinar on August 30th</a>.

				<li><strong>Review of selected open smart city best practices in four international cities (Chicago, Dublin, Helsinki, and New York).</strong> The literature review will focus on approaches to open and geospatial data standardization in a smart city context. These cities were chosen for their innovative geospatial and open data policies and practices. Results were presented during a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PI8Vid_V-XeBJWujUaxZxUP6Gf4b2jXj" target="_blank">webinar on December 14th</a>. Watch the presentation <a href="http://vimeo.com/247378746" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qbyzj/" target="_blank">Inter-jurisdictional case study.</a></strong> To situate open smart city policies and data management practices in Canada’s inter-jurisdictional context, OpenNorth conducted interviews with officials from the Province of Ontario and consulted with officials at the Province of British Columbia.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/open-smart-cities-guide" target="_blank">Open Smart Cities Guide V1.0.</a></strong> This final phase of the project provides a definition for an Open Smart City. This output intends to guide Canadian municipalities toward co-creating Open Smart Cities with their stakeholders and residents. Results will be disseminated broadly and were presented during the project’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BGYXu2atLRb113ojNhvAkY649adkQUUD/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">third webinar on April 17</a>.

			<h3 id="2">Aligning Local Open Data Programs with International Best Practices</h3>
			<h5>Jan 2017 - Ongoing<br />
			Open Data Charter Secretariat</h5>
			<p>The Government of Canada was among the key global partners that led the creation of the Open Data Charter (ODC) in 2015. More than 50 governments have adopted the ODC to date, including the City of Edmonton and the Province of Ontario. As a Steward of the ODC, OpenNorth conducted a study in early 2017 to identify how local and provincial governments in Canada could <strong>align open data programs with ODS principles</strong> and its framework. See <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/2017/01/30/final-report-aligning-canadian-open-data-programs-with-international-best-practices.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. OpenNorth was since contracted by the Open Data Charter Secretariat to interview city managers, local civic leaders, and elected officials from 4 cities in Canada, the Province of Ontario, 3 cities around the world (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Lviv, Ukraine; Durham, NC, USA) to identify <strong>adoption barriers, interests, future plans, and support needs</strong>.</p>

			<h3 id="4">Developing and Facilitating Multi-Stakeholder Data Governance Initiatives</h3>
			<h5>Jul 2017 - Mar 2018<br />
			Quartier des spectacles (QdS), City of Montréal</h5>
			<p>Led by the Partenariat du Quartier des Spectacles, which coordinates engagement strategies and initiatives in Montreal’s foremost arts and entertainment district, OpenNorth is developing and facilitating a <strong>multi-stakeholder shared data governance</strong> working group with cultural industry stakeholders. The initiative includes all major cultural venues in the area, research institutions, and provincial government partners. The sharing governance model will include: <strong>data life cycle management</strong> procedures, joint data <strong>ontologies</strong> and <strong>standards</strong>, technical <strong>capacity building</strong>, a <strong>common policy framework</strong> and prototypes and <strong>tools</strong> to demonstrate the value added of shared data collaboration (e.g. market research and analysis, business development, data visualization). Building on our experience initiating the Province of Quebec’s <a href="https://www.donneesquebec.ca/fr/" target="_blank">multijurisdictional open data portal</a>, the QdS model is being documented to scale and funding is currently being sought to sustain and expand the ongoing Montreal initiative.</p>

			<h3 id="5"><a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/toolkit/diy" target="_blank">Municipal Do-It-Yourself Open Data Toolkit</a></h3>
			<h5>Apr 2017 - Sep 2017<br />
			Treasury Board Secretariat, Government of Canada</h5>
			<p>OpenNorth was contracted by TBS to develop a <a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/toolkit/diy" target="_blank">municipal Do-It-Yourself (DIY) open data toolkit</a> for Canadian cities that have yet to implement open data initiatives. The toolkit was developed in collaboration with <strong>15 Canadian cities</strong> of different sizes and capacity with advanced open data programs. The DIY provides program management guidelines and examples of documented benefits, <strong>roadmap and planning templates</strong>, use cases and check lists, and a <strong>comprehensive list of resources</strong> (i.e. standards, policies, risk analysis) to help municipalities begin opening their data and join the Canadian open data community. The DIY also gives advice on <strong>data stakeholder needs identification</strong> and sustainable <strong>engagement</strong> practices. Adapted for its specific audience, the toolkit also provides labour and cost estimates required for municipalities to start their own initiatives. OpenNorth is currently in discussion with different provincial governments to adapt, prototype, and deploy the DIY regionally as well as develop advanced versions of the DIY. <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/do-it-yourself-open-data-toolkit" target="_blank">Explore the Municipal Open Data Toolkit</a> here, hosted by the Government of Canada.</p>

			<h3 id="6">Open Data Standards Pilot Project</h3>
			<h4>Increasing Open Data Value via Discoverability and Interoperability</h4>
			<h5>February 2018 - June 2018</h5>
			<p>The Municipal Information Systems Association (MISA) Ontario and OpenNorth are partnering on an open data standards pilot project.  The project will develop draft data standards for the “top 10” open data sets together with a standards adoption standard.</p>
			<p>The project will include the following tasks:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Defining “top 10” open data sets through research and a survey of MISA Ontario members;</li>
			<li>Collaborating with participating municipalities in acquiring detailed information (e.g data set name, tags/keywords, metadata and data dictionaries) related to the top 10 data sets;</li>
			<li>Mapping data set information and analyzing commonality and variations among the municipalities definition of the top 10 datasets;</li>
			<li>Developing draft standards for the top 10 data sets based on information received from municipalities and from domain specific organizations;</li>
			<li>Researching open data categories and recommending a standard set of categories;</li>
			<li>Developing and supporting an adoption strategy for the pilot project’s draft open data standards; and</li>
			<li>Co- presenting with MISA Ontario project working group at their annual conference (June 3-6, Hamilton).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additional information may be found in the <a href="http://www.misa-asim.ca/news/388366/MISA-Ontario-And-OpenNorth-Launch-Open-Data-Standards-Pilot-for-Municipalities.htm" target="_blank">MISA Ontario news release</a>.</p>
			<p>This pilot project is seen as an important step towards improving discoverability and interoperability of open data in Canada.
