	  <p>Do you want to put your academic training into practice and support public sector transformation? Are you passionate about digital technology and the future of urban development? Want to be part of a dynamic and growing team of social scientists engaging in interdisciplinary research on data ecosystems?</p>
      <p>OpenNorth is seeking to fill <strong>two (2) Data Analyst</strong> positions for its Applied Research Lab.</p>
      
      <h4>Open North</h4>
      <p>Founded in 2011, OpenNorth is Canada’s leading not-for-profit organization specialized in open data, open government, community engagement, open smart cities and civic technology. We work with Canada’s largest, most innovative, and connected cities. Our network extends across the country and globally through communities of practice and open government partners. Our work promotes the effective use of data as infrastructure facilitating sustained engagement between government, civil society, and the public.</p>

	  <h4>Open North Applied Research Lab</h4>
	  <p>Applied research has a key role at OpenNorth. Research is a foundational element to all projects and programmes at OpenNorth and covers everything from planning and design stages of a project, to the evaluation of impact. The Applied Research Lab brings together all of OpenNorth learnings into a single, multidisciplinary unit. The Lab is comprised of researchers with backgrounds in the social sciences, such as geography and economics, and is working towards an interdisciplinary approach to data-related problems including: mapping data ecosystems, choices of technologies, data management, standardisation, and analysis. </br>OpenNorth will be receiving funding from the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation to support the growth of the Applied Research Lab.</p>

      <h3>Job Description</h3>
      <p>OpenNorth is seeking to fill two analyst positions. OpenNorth is seeking individuals with strong social science backgrounds, inclined towards both theory and practice, and a strong affinity for research synthesis. Candidates will have experience in social science research in an academic setting and may have authored or co-authored peer-reviewed publications. Responsibilities will vary according to experience.</br>
	  The analysts will assume a hands-on role in a research team and be responsible for supporting and delivering a variety of research projects in the realm of open data, open government, and much more. These projects pertain to issues of citizen engagement, public policy, spatial data, and data standardisation, at the municipal level. Projects are both local and international. </br>The analysts may collect data through methods such as online surveys, in-person interviews, focus groups, documentation or archive research, and more. Analysis may require both quantitative and qualitative methods, with the potential for development of scripts to automate certain analysis tasks or data collection. Analysts will also be required to apply their own critical thinking to synthesise information from multiple sources and domains. </br>Since the Applied Research Lab is a multidisciplinary team, analysts are required to be able to interact with and learn from other disciplines and their scholarly output, keep up with the latest developments in a number of domains, and broad make connections to domains outside of their work at OpenNorth. A strong affinity for reading and critical thought is a must at the OpenNorth Applied Research Lab.</br>
