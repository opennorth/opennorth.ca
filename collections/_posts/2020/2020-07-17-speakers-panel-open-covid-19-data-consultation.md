On July 2, 2020, Open North conducted a consultation on the role of data in the COVID-19 pandemic in collaboration with the Standards Council of Canada. Close to 100 people gathered to think about ways to leverage data to help recover from the pandemic and better prepare for future health crises. Five guest panelists discussed how data has been used so far during the COVID-19 pandemic. They share their thoughts on the areas where Canada can improve upon data release and sharing to mitigate disease spread, understand the impact on our communities, and evaluate government actions.

Our speakers included:

* **Mr. Anil Arora**, Chief Statistician of Canada
* **Ms. Bonnie Healy**, Health Director at Blackfoot Confederacy
* **Mr. Éric Martel**, Head of the Performance, Analysis, and Evaluation Branch at the Integrated University Center for Health and Social Services (CIUSSS), Montreal
* **Dr. Erin Strumpf**, McGill University Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar in health economics, studying healthcare service delivery and inequalities in health outcomes.
* **Mr. Mark Leggott**, Executive Director, Research Data Canada
