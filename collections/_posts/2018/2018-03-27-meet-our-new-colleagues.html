<p>As a researcher in urban development, Robin Basalaev-Binder’s professional interests center on understanding and addressing socio-economic inequalities and injustice in the North American context, and globally. In addition to being a core researcher at OpenNorth, Robin is also a Research Associate at the McGill School of Urban Planning, exploring questions of urban governance in sustainability and resilience planning in Montreal, New York, and other North American cities. Robin has a forthcoming publication, co-authored with her colleagues from McGill, titled <a href="http://www.sharebetter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/High-Cost-Short-Term-Rentals.pdf" target="_blank">The High Cost of Short-Term Rentals in New York City</a>. Robin’s personal interests align closely with those of her research, tying urban planning and development into art, community, music, food, history, and their ultimate coming together in human interactions.
