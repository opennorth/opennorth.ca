Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) commissioned this study from OpenNorth in 2016, when Canada was facing an influx of Syrian refugees. The report focuses on how IRCCâ€™s open data strategy and infrastructure could better meet the data and information needs of their stakeholders, with key recommendations on data quality, accessibility and standards. The study is based on a combined qualitative and qualitative data user needs identification methodology developed by OpenNorth.
