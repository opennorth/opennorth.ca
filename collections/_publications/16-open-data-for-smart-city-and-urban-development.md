Open data has proven useful in the global South where progress can often be inhibited by socioeconomic factors. In such places, open data enables governments, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local public and private leaders to innovate and create. Events such as the International Open Data Conference (IODC) and organisations such as the Open Data for Development network (OD4D) provide a home for open data practitioners from the global South. This report examines the responses of 15 city officials during structured interviews OpenNorth conducted in eight cities including Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Accra, Ghana; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Cape Town, South Africa; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu, Nepal; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and, Montevideo, Uruguay. The report concludes with recommendations for facilitating increased networking across the global South as a means to solve the intractable problems urban areas face.
