Creating vibrant communities, maintaining mobility, delivering essential services, and creating low-carbon development may depend on the critical role open data plays for many cities and their citizens. Achieving each of these goals means reconciling differing visions of what effective urban development looks like and means. The ongoing growth of the urban environment and of urban density brings with it both opportunities and challenges. Published in the State of Open Data (2019), this chapter examines how the open data movement has shifted away from events such as hackathons to work on data standards, infrastructure, and in-house analytical capacity within city governments. It examines the implications of these shifts for urban development and the future of open data as an integral part of urban governance.
