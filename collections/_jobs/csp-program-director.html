<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In October 2018, the Government of Canada selected Evergreen and its partners, including OpenNorth, to receive up to $4.6 million in Smart Cities Community Support Program funding over two years, until March 2020. The Community Solutions Network (CSN) was established with this funding as a community-centric platform, providing communities of all sizes with the knowledge, expertise, experience and guidance they need to build internal capacity and navigate the smart cities landscape through the One-to-One Advisory Service, and event-based programs.</p>
<p>OpenNorth is the lead technical partner of the CSN. It is responsible for the network’s One-to-One Advisory Service with a specific approach and focus on open smart cities.

<p>The intended audiences of the Advisory Service are elected officials, high level decision makers, and technical leads within cities and communities.
