<p>OpenNorth is looking for <strong>one Research Analyst</strong> with advanced analysis and policy experience and a background in political science or related field</p>

<p>Do you want to put your academic training into practice and support public sector transformation? Are you passionate about digital technology and the future of digital government? Want to be part of a dynamic and growing team of social scientists engaging in interdisciplinary research on citizen-government interaction?</p>

<h3>OpenNorth</h3>
<p>Founded in 2011, OpenNorth is Canada’s leading not-for-profit organization specialized in open data, open government, community engagement, open smart cities and civic technology. We work with Canada’s largest, most innovative, and connected cities. Our network extends across the country and globally through communities of practice and open government partners. Our work promotes the effective use of data as infrastructure facilitating sustained engagement between government, civil society, and the public.</p>

<h3>OpenNorth Applied Research Lab</h3>
<p>Applied research has a key role at OpenNorth. Research is a foundational element to all projects and programmes at OpenNorth and covers everything from planning and design, to implementation and evaluation of a project. The Applied Research Lab brings together all OpenNorth knowledge into a single, multidisciplinary unit. The Lab is comprised of researchers with backgrounds in the social sciences, such as geography and economics, and is working towards an interdisciplinary approach to data-related problems including: mapping data ecosystems, choices of technologies, data management, standardisation, and analysis.</p>

<h3>Job description</h3>
<p>OpenNorth is seeking one (1) individual with strong social science background, inclined towards both theory and practice.
<br>The successful candidate will have a background related to political science and text analysis. They will have completed research at the Master's level in political science or a related field, and will have experience authoring or co-authoring peer-reviewed publications. They will apply their knowledge to issues such as data management, policy and strategy, data literacy, and the design of approaches to citizen-government interaction.
<br>The analyst will assume a hands-on role in a research team and be responsible for supporting and delivering a variety of research projects. These projects pertain to issues of citizen engagement, public policy, spatial data, and data standardisation, at the municipal level. Projects are both local and international.
<br>Specific to this position, the analyst will engage in supporting OpenNorth’s existing subgrant with the National Democratic Institute (NDI). The focus of this subgrant is to build capacity in public consultation, which <strong>requires experience with both automated and manual approaches to content analysis.</strong>
<br>The analyst may collect data through methods such as online surveys, in-person interviews, focus groups, documentation or archive research, and more. Analysis may require both quantitative and qualitative methods, with the potential need for development of scripts to automate data collection, data processing, and analysis. Analysts will also be required to apply their own critical thinking to synthesise information from multiple sources and domains.
<br>Since the Applied Research Lab is a multidisciplinary team, analysts are required to be able to interact with and learn from other disciplines and their scholarly output, keep up with the latest developments in a number of domains, and broad make connections to domains outside of their work at OpenNorth. A strong affinity for reading and critical thought is a must at the OpenNorth Applied Research Lab.
