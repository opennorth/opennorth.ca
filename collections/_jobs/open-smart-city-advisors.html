<p><em>Open North is seeking Advisors to join its Advisory Service on a consulting basis to provide support to municipal staff on the use of data & technology.</em></p>

<p>Open North’s Advisory Service is recruiting experts in smart city domains to assist in one-on-one consultations with communities across Canada. The Advisory Service offers a range of activities focused on building municipal staff capacity on specific open smart city topics. These include data governance, procurement, privacy, digital infrastructure, public engagement, and more. The main services provided include advisory calls with experts specialized in smart cities, access to a catalog of open smart city courses and other learning resources, and domain-specific workshops tailored to communities’ needs. <a href= "https://portal.futurecitiescanada.ca/docs/CSN_AdvisoryServices_Overview_ENG.pdf">For an overview of the Advisory Services, click here [pdf].</a></p>
<p>Advisors will provide personalized advice to communities participating in the Advisory Service, facilitated by Open North. This includes small, medium, large, rural, remote and Indigenous communities across Canada. This advice will primarily be provided on a one-to-one basis to municipal public servants (including senior managers, technical leads and elected officials), with opportunities for webinars and workshops as well.</p>
<p>Due to restrictions on meetings and travel, Advisory Services will be offered remotely for the time being. Advisors will be placed on a roster and matched with communities by Open North based on availability, expertise and community needs. Advisors will also be invited to develop online resources for learning and capacity building, participate in the overall development of the Advisory Service, and take part in other Open North projects, as appropriate.</p>
<p>This is an exciting opportunity to join a pan-Canadian network of leading experts on open smart cities, and to engage with Open North’s research and thought leadership.

<p>Open North is seeking Advisors who have expertise across a range of smart city domains and have experience in working with the public sector, especially municipalities. Services will be offered in English as well as French.</p>
