  “OpenNorth, through Jean-Noé Landry, was a founding member and an integral
  contributor to **Canada's Open Government Multi-Stakeholder Forum** in its
  inaugural year of 2018.  OpenNorth's deep open government experience and
  global perspective proved invaluable during the growing pains of this
  innovative and potentially transformational forum.  OpenNorth also helped the
  Forum navigate the complex relationships government departments have with
  civil society and each other.”

We have co-led a group of Canadian civil society organizations in lobbying for the creation of a Multi-Stakeholder Forum. This collaborative platform allows government and civil society, as partners, to co-create their Open Government Partnership (OGP) action plans and oversee their implementation. These action plans are created every two years, with Canada and more than 75 other countries required to develop action plans outlining their openness and other commitments over the upcoming two years. The OGP requires members to engage in public consultation in preparing and implementing its plan and this forum strengthens dialogue between the Canadian government and civil society to support a more open and transparent government. Canada has assumed its seat on the OGP Steering Committee, making it even more important for robust action by its civil society to hold the government to account.
