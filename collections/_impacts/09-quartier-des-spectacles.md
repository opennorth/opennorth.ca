Led by the Partenariat du Quartier des Spectacles, we are developing and facilitating a multi-stakeholder shared data governance working group with cultural industry stakeholders. Quartier des Spectacles, which coordinates engagement strategies and initiatives in Montreal’s foremost arts and entertainment district, includes the major cultural venues in the area, research institutions, and provincial government partners. Based on our work, the Quartier des spectacles also established a new not-for-profit organization to improve urban quality of life and we continue to apply this method to other urban development issues, like homelessness and food security. The sharing governance model includes: data life cycle management procedures, joint data ontologies and standards, technical capacity building, a common policy framework and prototypes and tools to demonstrate the value added of shared data collaboration (e.g. market research and analysis, business development, data visualization). This work builds on our experience initiating the Province of Quebec’s [multijurisdictional open data portal](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/fr/ "multijurisdictional open data portal").
