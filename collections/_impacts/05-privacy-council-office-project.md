We explored the following question for the PCO: How can we make qualitative consultation data more reusable for the Federal Government? The goal was to examine variations in the structure of qualitative consultation data and its potential to be used in analysis tools. Our examination included four consultation datasets from the Government of Canadaâ€™s [open data portal](http://open.canada.ca/ "Open data portal") (and one internal consultation dataset) and prototyped a workflow to process and analysis qualitative consultation data.

This involved processing qualitative data (e.g. individual respondent answers) into structures that would ease the process of automated content analysis (e.g. Natural Language Processing [NLP] and sentiment analysis). From this exploration, recommendations were made on a data model that captures the intricacies of dialogue between government and stakeholders. Resulting code from the project can be found in its own Github [repository](https://github.com/canada-ca/content-analysis "Github repository").
