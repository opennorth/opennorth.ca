We designed Popolo to be data standards that create interoperability within the civic tech community by standardising data structure on political events and entities. This eases the process of modelling objects such as government institutions, elected officials and events to enable anyone to applying data to real urban problems. Creating interoperability also allows for better monitoring platforms and exchange of data within the civic tech community. Popolo has been used in platforms such as [AskThem](http://www.askthem.io/ "AskThem"), which allows citizens to search for their elected officials, submit questions, and receive a response. Popoloâ€™s simplicity allows platforms to easily connect to one another to enable the querying of elected officials from any number of political jurisdictions. Popolo is an underlying standard for the [Poplus](http://poplus.org/ "Poplus") civic tech ecosystem, which supports the development of reusable open source software components that can be used by civic app developers around the world.
