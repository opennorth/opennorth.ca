  “**Represent API** is a service that allows anyone to find their elected
  officials and electoral districts based upon their location. And it’s the
  largest database of its kind. The API is used to perform millions of these
  lookups every year by dozens of organizations that we know from all sides of
  the political spectrum.”

Through Represent API, we make open data into public infrastructure by enabling citizens to use it to contact their elected officials. Our open source resource uses this infrastructure to connect individuals with their municipal, provincial and, federal representatives and provides information about the electoral district. By entering a postal code or geocoded address, citizens can find out who represents their riding and how to reach them. Access to this information enables individuals to build “email your representative” campaigns and other community-based advocacy initiatives, amplifying their voices, and ensuring their perspectives are heard by political candidates and elected members of government. Because of the simplicity in its data structure, Represent API can scale to almost any political jurisdiction worldwide and already counts over 30 Canada-based organizations amongst its users. For social justice organizations, unions, and nonprofits, this tool helps organizers map their existing supporters to specific electoral districts.
