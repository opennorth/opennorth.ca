  “Both citizens and elected officials appreciated the outreach and educational
  aspects of **Citizen Budget**, to better understand the budget and the
  difficulties in making decisions to achieve a balanced budget. It is no longer
  a question of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars over three years in
  order for a small select group to vote on how to spend one or two million
  dollars.”

Working with the City of Montreal’s brough Plateau-Mont-Royal in 2013, we developed a user-friendly and fun online budget simulator to increase civic participation in decision-making and support elected representatives in better representing the interests and priorities of local residents. Over 100 cities have used Citizen Budget to broaden the budget engagement of their entire community, and we have seem an average of 15 percent increase in participation in municipal budget meetings while also educating residents on the budget process. This makes Citizen Budget Canada's leading budget engagement tool. Unlike a regular survey or data visualizations, Citizen Budget is an interactive platform with three modules (Tax Impact, Balanced Budget, and Dollar Allocation) that show the financial impacts of participants’ choices in real time, educating them about the trade-offs and constraints faced by their local government. It has been used by more than 80 cities across North America (including the cities of Edmonton, Ottawa, and Regina). Citizen Budget represents a clear improvement over public meetings which involve travel, time, child minding and other accessibility constraints. Revenue generated by Citizen Budget helps sustain OpenNorth’s mission and operations.
