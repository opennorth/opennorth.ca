To support the efforts of cities to open up their data, Open North, and the Government of Canada have developed a do-it-yourself open data toolkit for municipalities. This toolkit has been presented at the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group on Open Government, used by the province of Yukon, and formed the basis of peer-to-peer learning exchanges with like minded organizations in Europe and South and Central America. It even inspired Open Data Durban in developing its own. The toolkit is aimed at municipalities that have not yet begun an open data project but need some guidance on how to implement one.
