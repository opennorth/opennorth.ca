	  <p>OpenNorth is opening up <strong>two positions</strong> in the burgeoning field of <strong>Open Smart Cities</strong>, welcoming skilled communicators with group facilitation and collaborative approaches skills, project leadership background, good knowledge of current technology landscape and of technology impacts on citizens, innovative mindset, cultural sensitivity, and excellence in service delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> this is a mid-level position.</p>
      <p>The Government of Canada announced that Evergreen, working in partnership with OpenNorth, their Future Cities Canada collaborative platform and numerous non-profit institutions, foundations and stakeholders across Canada, will receive funding over two years to deliver activities from the new Smart Cities Community Support Program (CSP). The funding supports <strong>capacity-building services for communities</strong> nationwide, including the establishment of a national one-to-one advisory service for open, smart communities and cities. OpenNorth is the lead technical partner of this consortium responsible for the one-to-one advisory services. The CSP runs until March 2020.</p>
      
      <h4>Open North</h4>
      <p>Founded in 2011, OpenNorth is Canada’s leading not-for-profit organization specialized in open data, open government, community engagement, open smart cities and civic technology. We work with Canada’s largest, most innovative, and connected cities. Our network extends across the country and globally through communities of practice and open government partners. Our work promotes the effective use of data as infrastructure facilitating sustained engagement between government, civil society, and the public.</p>
      
      <h3>Job Description</h3>
      <p>As part of the OpenNorth team under the leadership of the Executive Director, and working in close coordination with Evergreen and program partners, the successful candidate will work directly with cities and communities representatives, under the supervision of OpenNorth’s CSP Director. Montreal’s CSP team includes <strong>two Project Leads</strong> supervising <strong>two junior Research Analysts</strong>, and interfaces with an OpenNorth <strong>Senior Program Manager</strong> at Ottawa’s CSP office.</p>
	  
	  <p>OpenNorth’s CSP team focuses on specific domain areas: people and engagement, governance, technology (software / hardware, data). All candidates for CSP positions should demonstrate knowledge and/or practical experience in several of these areas. The division of labour between the <strong>two Project Leads</strong> will be determined according to the team’s composition. They will work closely with OpenNorth’s Applied Research Lab and coordinate the input of CSP partners and clients.</p>
	  
	  <p>Successful candidates will draw upon their service orientation, problem-solving, authenticity, empathy and capacity-building competencies, their analytical abilities and experience (in qualitative and quantitative data analysis), their knowledge in social sciences, and their critical thinking to work throughout the program. In the context of strengthening the skills, competencies and abilities of people and communities (including First Nations communities) looking to achieve their CSP-related goals, successful candidates will regularly share and exchange with cities and community representatives: to understand and contextually assess issues and stakeholders’ motivations; to create and deliver timely and appropriate guidance materials; to accompany select communities on their learning/implementation journey; and to monitor progress made by Canadian communities. They will be able to surface issues pertaining to technology introduction and usage in order to achieve a communities’ goal, to conduct transdisciplinary research, to use creative and synergistic collaborative processes, and to coordinate expert resources in order to provide guidance and/or create a learning space in which community understanding about various impacts of technology use is improved. They will apply values-based knowledges to their understanding of civic and socioeconomic issues in Canadian communities, and to critical data issues such as data literacy, digital divides, and social equity in the application of technologies. They will be able to synthesise information, knowhow and approaches from multiple disciplines, and bring this synthesis to the service of Canadian communities so these may benefit from measurable positive outcomes.</p>
