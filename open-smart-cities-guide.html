			<h2>Open Smart Cities Guide v1.0</h2>
			<p>The Open Smart Cities Guide is the end result of Open Smart Cities in Canada, a year long collaborative research project led by OpenNorth and funded by Natural Resources Canada's GeoConnections program.</p>
			<p>This guide provides a first ever definition for an Open Smart City and is intended as a starter kit for city stakeholders and decision makers. We expect that this living document will grow as we receive more input and learn about additional people, projects, practices and  resources that contribute to Open Smart Cities.</p>
			<p>Please feel free to email <a href="mailto:info@opennorth.ca">info@opennorth.ca</a> for more information or to provide your input.</p>

			<p>Open Smart Cities in Canada is a collaborative project. We would like to thank smart city representatives from the cities of Edmonton, Guelph, Montréal, and Ottawa and officials from the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario for sharing their time, expertise, and experiences with us. Furthermore, this project benefits from contributions made by the project’s core team of experts and researchers. We are grateful to Professor Tracey P. Lauriault (Carleton University), David Fewer, LL.M., (Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC)), and Professor Mark Fox (University of Toronto) for providing their expert advice on the design of research and its outputs. Finally, we thank graduate students Stephen Letts and Carly Livingstone (Carleton University) for research assistance and editing over the course of the project.</p>
