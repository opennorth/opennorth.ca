			<h2 class="e-section-title">Approach and Audience</h2>
			<p>We have broken down our approach into two major dimensions: domains and principles.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Domains</strong> (and sub-domains) reflect the substantive matter of the smart city, including governance, people and engagement, data, and software and hardware.</li>
				<li><strong>Principles</strong> (and sub-principles) reflect the lens through which the components of the smart city are viewed, including openness, accountability, control, and innovation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At <strong>no cost</strong> to the community, the One-to-One Advisory Service offers basic and advanced courses online, guidelines, templates, as well as personalized guidance from leading advisors on a range of open smart cities and relevant topics, including open standards in procurement, implementing a privacy policy, approaches to data & tech literacy, developing ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence, and building awareness of indigenous data sovereignty, and much more.</p>
			<p>The intended audiences of the Advisory Service are <strong>elected officials</strong>, <strong>high level decision makers</strong>, and <strong>technical leads</strong> within cities and communities.</p>

			<h2 class="e-section-title">Intake Process</h2>
			<p>Engaging with the One-to-One Advisory Service team follows a series simple steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A community undergoes a needs assessment interview to gather data on its specific needs and  challenges;</li>
				<li>The community completes a diagnostic self-assessment questionnaire to capture community-level capacities on a range of Open Smart Cities topics;</li>
				<li>A validation interview is carried out with the One-to-One Advisory Service team to ensure the community’s needs and priorities are clear;</li>
				<li>Lastly, a tailored Capacity-building Action Plan (CAP) is created, which summarizes all findings and identifies a specific and critical activity to develop in order to achieve a short-term, impactful action. The CAP outline a customized learning pathway.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The One-to-One Advisory Service is designed as a structured process that consists of a tailored needs assessment, capacity-building action plan, and service delivery.</p>
			<p>Communities across all regions are currently being invited to apply and confirm their eligibility to the Advisory Service.

			<p>The One-to-One Advisory Service builds upon OpenNorth’s history of promoting intra and interjurisdictional data interoperability, policy coherence, and critical insight into data ecosystems. Specifically, OpenNorth brings its experience in the development of data standards, open data strategies, and multi-stakeholder problem identification, to develop this One-to-One Advisory Service with a strong grounding in the practical concerns of Canadian cities and communities. The One-to-One Advisory Service is further supported by OpenNorth’s network of leading academics and practitioners in Canada, with expertise in disciplines such as geography, GIS, law, and urban planning, and domain knowledge in areas such as social justice, public engagement, and software. Through this combination of expertise and experience, OpenNorth is bringing values of transparency, accountability, citizen engagement, and interoperability, to smart cities.</p>
